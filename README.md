# Density-Analysis



Approach: For Density Analysis I extracted text from the Title, Header and Paragraph tag. Cleaned up the data by removing the unnecessary words and calculated 2grams of all the words. Using 2grams I calculated the keyword density and displayed the top 5 phrases that best describe the webpage.
